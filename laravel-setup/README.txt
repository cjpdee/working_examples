Instructions for setting up a new Laravel Mix project:

Install laravel-mix & import webpack.mix.js:

mkdir my-app
cd my-app
yarn add laravel-mix
cp node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.mix.js ./

then clone this webpack.mix.js & package.json to my-app

my-app will follow the same structure as this directory

make sure the repo has a .gitignore to prevent node_modules being commited
